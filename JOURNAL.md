## 10/11/2025 - Started designing PCB  

Today I started designing the PCB in KiCad, the project started taking place in a more technical form, I imported all the neccessary modules and components, it took a bit time to make sure that all the footprints were okay. This is my first time designing a PCB, so I am learning alot with tutorials and from my friend who is helping. The next step is to make the connections!

## 10/12/2025 - I finished the PCB  

Today I finished designing the PCB of my game console. It took me a quite while learning how everything works. I double-checked all the connections, and made sure the power lines were clean. I can't wait for this design to actually exist as a physical board I can hold and test. This project taught me a lot about electronics design and patience. I can’t wait to assemble it. ![image.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MTg2NSwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--1c87a70c7fcc9671e7585e728074bc97ac5c3f7d/image.png)

## 10/13/2025 12 AM - Calculated and updated my github  

I calculated the prices of the modules and organized everything into a bom.csv file with links. I also exported the 3d model of the pcb. I can really start to see how everything is coming together. I’m pretty excited because I’m getting closer to turning this little game console into reality.

## 10/13/2025 9 PM - I made a prototype with modules I found home and cardboard  

Today I found a cheap display and I wanted to make a cheap prototype to my project with the display and an arduino nano clone and cardboard. I made a quick code so i could play an easy game on this "console" I made

## 10/13/2025 10 PM - I realized something  

I forgot that I should count in the price of the PCB too, I estimated the PCB to be $2 and the shipping $3 so in total the PCB will be around $5, I will update the bom.csv file, but when I filled the estimation in the "Ship it!" section I only said $48, so with this recalculation it would be $53.

## 10/16/2025 - Research  

I spent some time researching which free 3D software I should use to design the case. I ended up downloading FreeCad, and I will do the measurements later and try to model the case with the help of my friend. I will also have to think about if I want to use a plastic glass over the screen or no.

## 10/19/2025 - I started designing the case  

I downloaded FreeCAD to design my case but I'm having a hard time learning it. As of now I am searching for the 3d models of the modules and I'm modelling those who have no available 3d models online. This program is pretty complicated for me unlike blender but with the help of my friend I will get the hang of it.

## 10/20/2025 - I collected 3d models  

I collected the 3d models of all the modules and put them on the 3d model of the pcb so I can see how it will look and I can start designing the case properly, I didn't find the model of my exact display but i found one that seems to be very very similiar in size

## 10/24/2025 5:06 PM - I designed the case  

I finished designing the whole case, it is made out of 2 bodies, the bottom and the top of the case. After importing the 3d models of the modules it was easier and cleaner to model the case.

## 10/24/2025 5:47 PM - I recalculated prices cleaner and updated the bom  

I recalculated so I only have to order from 3 sites, also recalculated the prices and since some special offers are no longer available the price went up. I updated the bom,csv file with everything.

## 11/1/2025 - I ordered everything  

I ordered every module and the PCB. I originally ordered the XIAO microcontroller from the SpeedStudio website but they didn't accept my order because of the card I guess. They refunded the money so I ordered the XIAO from aliexpress just like the other modules.
